My solution to the **Simple FAQ** challenge is a responsive webpage that displays a list of frequently asked questions and their answers. The design is clean and modern, adapting to different screen sizes to provide an excellent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I strengthened my skills in:

  - **Semantic HTML**: I used tags like `<main>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ol>`, and `<ul>` to structure the content clearly and accessibly.
  - **Responsive Design with Media Queries**: I implemented `media queries` in CSS to adapt the page's layout for different screen sizes (1024px and 640px), ensuring it looks great on any device.
  - **Advanced CSS Styling**: I applied `box-shadows`, `border-radius`, and `hover` effects to create a visually appealing and interactive interface.
  - **Code Organization**: I kept the CSS code well-organized and commented, making it easier to read and maintain in the future.

### Useful resources

  - [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - An invaluable reference source for HTML and CSS properties, especially for the syntax and use of `media queries`.
  - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Useful for quick examples and demonstrations of CSS properties.
  - [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - Helped me understand the importance of clear and concise commit messages in Git to maintain an organized project history.
